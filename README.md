# How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
Being absolutely sure that code is perfect from errors might be very difficult to achieve, but as developers we can try to reach as much as possible to that level. To do that code should be tested as much as possible, analyzing what could possibly make the code unstable or work inefficiently to find ways to properly handle such situations.

# How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
User needs can be interpreted trhough requirements gathering and documentation, these requirements are basically the guide to what the system should have and do to satisfy the user's needs.

# How do I approach designing software?
Design can be approached by first gathering requirements from the client, to then evaluate them and plan the development trough diagrams or any other tools. Furthermore, static testing should be done to ensure such requirements are not contradictory or ambiguous, because this will be the starting point to writing code. Software should then be designed following the parameters set in the documentation and tested to ensure major issues rae found and corrected.
